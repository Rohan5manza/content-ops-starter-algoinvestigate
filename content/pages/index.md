    subtitle: Personal brand of Rohan Anil Marar
    text: >+
      This is my personal brand. 


      I love **Sherlock Holmes** and his crime solving stories. I love **Albert
      Einstein** and his work in modern physics. I love Tony Stark's **Iron
      Man**. Growing up, I always wanted to be like these guys. I love engaging
      in daydreaming and imaginations, conducting thought experiments and
      thinking about theories. I am a visionary and a futurist. I intend to
      never give up on that child within me, that is always curious about
      stuff.  


      This brand is about exploring the world of hypotheses and possibilities in
      technology, with the spirit of a **mystery solver**.


      I write on many topics. This is mostly for my writings on topics such as
      mechanistic interpretability, abstract concepts like consciousness,
      mysteries surrounding deep learning and modern physics. I believe that
      mech interp is a subject with huge scope, that can turn into commerical
      practical domain with business uses. 


      This is about pursuing a topic that I am curious about, with the spirit of
      Sherlock Holmes, and writing about my journey and my ideas. I find that it
      is best for me when I pursue something with an "**investigative**"
      approach, like solving a mystery. 


      I also write a lot on many other topics, such as business, politics,
      history, physics, etc. Fiction, non-fiction, etc, both for normal blogs
      and articles, and as books I publish as a professional **author**. 


      "**The Algorithmic Investigator**" is hence a **pen name** I have adopted
      as an author, not just because I work with algorithms, but because there
      is elegance in the methods that can adopted by anyone studying a subject,
      by breaking down complex concepts into simple steps like an algorithm to
      be followed: a process of observation, deduction, and imagination.
